UnitTestingKata
===============

This is a small project used to assist in Unit Tests Code Katas. 

The project has no tests at all and the goal of this exercise is to create the needed tests to fix the following issues reported by the users:


    Bug Report 1 
      - Can you please make sure that we're not adding invalid LegalEntities to our system?
    
    Bug Report 2
      - Hey dumbass! I've been receiving two idential notification e-mails every morning... please, fix that!
    
    Bug Report 3
      - Dear IT Nerd, please stop playing DOTA and tell me why I didn't receive any notification email this morning... 
      After a quick investigation, we found this execution log:
             System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Unable to find the specified file.
